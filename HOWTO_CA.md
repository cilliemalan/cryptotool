# How to use Crypto Tool as a Certificate Authority
Though Crypto Tool doesn't have the workflow and features of a proper certification authority,
it can be used for basic CA processes. This guide will show how to generate client certificates
signed by a newly generated CA certificate.

## Step 1: Choosing a working directory
The first step is to choose a working directory. Preferably create a new directory that will contain your
CA and signed certificates.

## Step 2: Generate CA certificate
Next step is to generate a CA certificate. For this head to the CA page and do the following:
1. Enter the name of the CA certificate in the box to the left.

2. Select **Self Signed Certificate**.

3. Set the **Key Type**. For speed use ECDSA, for compatibility use RSA.

4. Fill in the **Subject**. This is optional.

5. Set the basic constraint as **Certificate Authority**. [Change Path
   Length to 1 or 2 if you want to do the whole intermediate
   thing](http://www.pkiglobe.org/index.html).

6. Deselect **Subject Alternative Name**. This is only for server certificates.

7. Make sure **Key Certificate Signature** is checked.

8. Click **Process**.

9. If you look at **Inspect** you will see the CA certificate.

## Step 3: Generate Client CSRs
Typically whoever is going to need the client certificate will generate a key and CSR.
1. Enter the names of client certificates. You may specify multiple.

2. Select **Create CSR**.

3. Select **Key Type**, enter the **Subject**.

4. Specify **End Entity** as Basic Constraint.

5. Make sure **Subject Alternative Name** is deselected. Again this is only for server certificates.

6. Make sure **Key Certificate Signature** is **NOT** selected.

7. Select **Client Authentication** and **Server Authentication** as Extended Usage. This will probably
   not be important but whatever.

8. Click **Process**.

9. If you look at **Inspect** you will see the Client Certificate Signing Requests along with Keys.

## Step 4: Sign CSRs
Lastly, we will sign the CSRs with our CA certificate. If the CSRs were generated by someone else, they
only need to provide the CSR, not the key.
1. Head over to the **Sign Certificates** tab.

2. Select the CA we generated from the dropdown. It will only be shown if it's marked as a Certificate Authority
   and you have the key.

3. Check the CSRs you want to sign.

4. Specify the duration. The certificate will start at the current day and end at the current day + the amount of
   years specified.

5. Click **Sign Certificates**.

6. If you head to **Inspect** you will notice there are now certificates corresponding to each of the CSR files
   that were signed. For someone to use the client certificate, they will need the certificate file and the
   corresponding key.
